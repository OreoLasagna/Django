Creating Virtual Environment:
py -m venv (ll_env)


Activating Virtual Environment: -After you've navigated to the proper folder directory-
ll_env\Scripts\activate

Deactivating the Virtual Environment:
deactivate


Viewing the Project and turning it out:
py manage.py runserver

Local Host is here - http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Slap that into your URL of a browser of your choice

>Then make new terminals to do everything else


Turning off the Project:
Ctrl + C


Creating a new app:
py manage.py startapp (learning_logs)

Updating a Database to include a specific app:
py manage.py makemigrations (learning_logs)

Here we are saying look at the learning_logs folder and grab any changes stuffed into models 
Then to publish it to the database you then run the py manage.py migrate call again to commit it to the DB
